/**
 * A GroovyBean is a JavaBean defined in Groovy. In Groovy, working with beans is
 * much easier than in Java. Groovy facilitates working with beans in three ways:
 *  ■ Generating the accessor methods
 *  ■ Allowing simplified access to all JavaBeans (including GroovyBeans)
 *  ■ Simplifying registration of event handlers together with annotations that declare
 * a property as bindable
